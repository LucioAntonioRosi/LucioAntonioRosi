# Lucio Antonio Rosi

Hello! I’m Lucio, a fifth-year Mathematical Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano and Sorbonne University who likes to spend time thinking about partial differential equations (PDEs).

## What keeps me busy

- **PDEs**: turning messy physical problems into solvable mathematics  
- **Improving with Python** 
- **Bridging theory and code**: elegant maths deserves equally elegant implementation  

## Let’s talk

If you would like to reach me out, drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucio-antonio-r-572483117). Always happy to swap ideas.
